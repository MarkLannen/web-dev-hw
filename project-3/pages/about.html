      The meaning of a story emerges in the meeting between the words on the page and the thoughts in the reader's mind. So when people ask me what I meant by this story, or what was the message I was trying to convey in that one, I have to explain that I'm not going to explain.
      Anyway, I'm not in the message business; I'm in the "Once upon a time" business.</p>

    <p class="first-line about-background">Pullman has a strong commitment to traditional British civil liberties and is noted for his criticism of growing state authority and government encroachment into everyday life. In February 2009, he was the keynote speaker at the Convention on Modern Liberty in London[37] and wrote an extended piece in The Times condemning the Labour government for its attacks on basic civil rights.[38] Later, he and other authors threatened to stop visiting schools in protest at new laws requiring them to be vetted to work with youngstersâ€”though officials claimed that the laws had been misinterpreted.</p
