      <p style="background-color: white;"><img src="./images/skull1-100px.JPG" alt="illustration of Oxford scene" align="left">Philip Pullman’s new trilogy starts before “His Dark Materials” begins.
The new trilogy is named <strong>“The Book of Dust,”</strong> after a mysterious elementary particle introduced in “His Dark Materials” that has something to do with consciousness and is the subject of great scientific and religious debate and anxiety. As the story opens, we find ourselves back in the curious Oxford of “The Golden Compass,” one that is real but not real, an off-kilter iteration set in some sort of Einsteinian alternate universe.
In this world everyone has a dæmon, an animal manifestation of his or her soul that changes form frequently in childhood but settles into a particular animal at adolescence. In this world, people read Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time,” but they also take photograms, travel by zeppelin and use anbaric energy to operate their machinery. There’s an academic field known as experimental theology.
When the novel begins, a terrible flood is impending and the formidable church, based in Geneva, is consolidating the power it will wield so frighteningly in the later books. Malcolm, an 11-year-old boy whose parents own an inn and whose prize possession is a canoe called La Belle Sauvage that gives the book its title, stumbles into the service of an underground group working to subvert the Magisterium, the church’s ruling body.

     <h2><em>The Independent</em></h2>
      <p style="background-color: white;"><img src="./images/moon1-100px.JPG" alt="illustration of Oxford scene" align="left">It’s been twenty-two years since we first met the plucky heroine of Philip Pullman’s masterful <strong><em>His Dark Materials trilogy,</strong></em> Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon. Beloved by readers the world over, the prospect of further chapters in Lyra’s story inflicted agonies of excited suspense since it was first announced that Pullman was writing a new trilogy, The Book of Dust, the first volume of which, La Belle Sauvage, is finally published. Set in the world that’s come to be known as Lyra’s (for those who haven’t read His Dark Materials, it jumps between realms), one that’s similar enough to our own to be recognisable, albeit with some not insignificant twists (most notably less technology and more magic), a decade before the story that begins in Northern Lights (the first His Dark Materials book), La Belle Sauvage recounts the story of Malcolm Polstead, “eleven years old, with and inquisitive, kindly disposition, a stocky build, and ginger hair,” and his daemon Asta. Malcolm’s parents own the Trout inn, which sits just outside Oxford on the banks of the Thames, a waterway that Malcolm navigates in his beloved canoe, La Belle Sauvage. Just across the river from the Trout is Godstow Priory, at which Malcolm is a regular visitor, helping the resident nuns with their chores or running errands for them up and down the river.
Thus, when a six-month-old baby girl named Lyra is handed over into the sisters’ care, Malcolm finds himself embroiled in a mysterious and increasingly dangerous adventure to protect the infant from evil forces.
