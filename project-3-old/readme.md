## Project 3 Readme
1. I am going to showcase a novel.
2. I will create a site that showcases "The Book of Dust" by Philip Pullman.
3. I'll download the book on to my kindle this week and likely include a sample from the introduction or forward - not sure yet how the novel is organized! Below is some Lorem ipsum placeholder text.

Quicquid enim a sapientia proficiscitur, id continuo debet expletum esse omnibus suis partibus; Quae tamen a te agetur non melior, quam illae sunt, quas interdum optines. Ratio quidem vestra sic cogit.

4. I'll use the bio from Phillip Pullman's [personal-website](http://www.philip-pullman.com/about)
5. I'll take my color palette from Mr. Pullmans [personal-website](http://www.philip-pullman.com/about) and the online images I've found of the cover of his new novel.

### Color Palette

I pulled these colors from a project that I did in my photoshop class where, serendipitously, I had to design a book cover and had already chosen the new Pullman book and had already thought through this color palette. The book has a classical location setting (Oxford) but could also be classified as a work of fantasy and I thought these muted colors, with one contrasting strong color (the red) evoked the mood of the book.

I'll use the gray for headings and the dark blue/green for paragraph text.

I'll use the turquoise and red for accents/hover states etc...

### Imagery

Phillip Pullmand has some excellent illustrations on his website. I'll use their aesthetic for the general 'feel' of my website.

I'll also use a cover that I created for the book in my Photoshop class.


### fonts

I have chosen Crete Rounded for headings, and ABeezee for parapraph text.
I chose those two fonts because they work together on a very fundamental level being serif and sans-serif, respectively. I liked Crete-Round for headings as it is a softer serif font that I think works well for headings in a page about a work of modern fiction. Even though the book has a classical setting (Oxford) it's themes are quite modern and Crete Round definitely has a modern, minimalist look and works well in this case. I chose Abeezee as a sans-serif paragraph text as it is very easy to read online and the curved bowls, ligatures and terminals etc... go very well with Crete Round.

11-6-2017. Finally ready to turn this in. I'm happy with how the colors, fonts and images etc... look in and of themselves, but I am looking forward to next week when I can work on the layout as there are obviously some issues that need addressing.  :)

Having trouble turning this in. I have pushed the project via githu desktop, but the updated version is not showing up on my live site.
