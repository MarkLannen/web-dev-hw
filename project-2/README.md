# Progress of Project 2 homework: The instructable.
***
## Sunday, Sept. 24 updates:
1. Sketched outline of project.
2. Collected all h3 headers and laid them out in the order in which they will appear in instructable.
3. Added all lists, blockquotes, required html, etc..
4. Published live through github desktop.

## Monday, Sept. 25 updates:
1. Corresponded with Justine on Slack and finally worked out how to submit homework.  :)
2. Updated README.md file and published to github.
3. Had cursory search around internet to get idea for what images/videos I can use as part of instructable.

## Sunday, Oct. 8 updates:
1. Added images and other required html to instructions page.
2. Created form page and tried to tried to build a box to enter emails for monthly newsletter subscription.
3. Atom crashes regularly (sometimes every few minutes) which is extremely frustrating as it can take a very long time to get anything done.
4. Still not really clear exactly how projects get submitted. Have made an appointment to see Justine tomorrow for more help.
5.
