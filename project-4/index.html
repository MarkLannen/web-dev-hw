     <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
      <p>Many people use mobile devices to surf the web and the numbers of users is increasing,
        but a cursory browse with one's phone will make it clear that  quite a bit of the web
        is not optimized for mobile devices. As mobile devices have smaller view ports and different
        screen ratios than desktops, they require a different approach to web development..</p>

      <p>There are so many different screen sizes exist across phones, "phablets,"
        tablets and desktops, that it is impractical to try and do a separate design for each size. As such
        it is imperative that a site looks good and works well on any
        screen size.</p>
        <q>Responsive Web Design is the combination of flexible grids,
                     flexible images, and media queries.</q>

      <p>According to this article on <a href="https://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751">Search Engine Land</a>,
        Google has rolled out a new mobile-first index that creates and ranks its search
        listings based on the mobile version of content. This should make it very clear
        that a 'mobile-first' design philosophy is absolutely essential
        today.</p>

       <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>A new technology, but with support now fairly widespread across browsers,
           Flexbox is starting to become ready for widespread use. Flexbox provides
           tools to allow rapid creation of complex, flexible layouts, and features
           that historically proved difficult with CSS.</p>
