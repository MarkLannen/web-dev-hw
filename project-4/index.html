     <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
      <p>The use of mobile devices to surf the web is growing at
        an astronomical pace, but unfortunately much of the web isn't optimized
        for those mobile devices. Mobile devices are often constrained by display
        size and require a different approach to how content is laid out on the
        screen.</p>

      <p>A multitude of different screen sizes exist across phones, "phablets,"
        tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, and even wearables. Screen sizes
        are always changing, so it's important that your site can adapt to any
        screen size, today or in the future.</p>

      <p>Google has rolled out a new mobile-first index. This means Google will
        create and rank its search listings based on the mobile version of content,
        even for listings that are shown to desktop users. It is now more important
        than ever that your mobile content be given first priority.</p>
         <blockquote>"Responsive Web Design is the combination of flexible grids,
                      flexible images, and media queries."
         </blockquote>

       <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>A new technology, but with support now fairly widespread across browsers,
           Flexbox is starting to become ready for widespread use. Flexbox provides
           tools to allow rapid creation of complex, flexible layouts, and features
           that historically proved difficult with CSS. This article explains all
           the fundamentals</p>
